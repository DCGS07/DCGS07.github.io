    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Knowing what a caesar cipher and a shift cipher is.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To learn how to cipher at least top shift 2 easily using a spreadsheet.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I exceeded it. I can cipher to shift 3 easily with minimal effort.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Looking and listening. That was the most effective strategy. I then did what I could to adapt it to the way that I setup my spreadsheet.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my habit to 'help' people by telling them the answers once I’m done. It gets in their way and prevents them from learning and being able to recycle the skills that we were taught as they didn’t use them themselves and ingrain that knowledge inside their long-term memory.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I could replace telling them the answer to giving them helpful clues. This way I can improve and stretch myself while being able to let them be able to do the same later after they have learnt the same skills that I have.</td>
